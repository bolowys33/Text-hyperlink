##This is a project about TEXTS and HYPERLINKS.
##Few steps to get started
- Clone the repository in the created folder for your project using: "git clone <repo_link> ./"
- Run rm -fr .git to destroy any previous git connection with the cloned remote repo
- From the terminal in your project folder, run the command "npm install" (You should see a generated node_modules folder)
create three pages about.html, contact.html and index.html (which has already be created)
Give a personal description in each of the HTML pages describing the name
add a hyper link in each of the HTML files to link you to the other pages in your website.
- To test your lint check for HTML run "npm run lint:html"
